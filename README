ABOUT
check_gputemp is a Nagios plugin which checks the GPU temperature of ATI based 
graphics card. It uses the aticonfig tool from ATI's proprietary driver fglrx.

This script checks the GPU temperature of ATI based graphics card using the 
aticonfig tool from their proprietary driver fglrx. The script is written in 
Bash and complies with the Nagios development guidelines. For example it uses 
the -w, -c and -v arguments, has some basic sanity checks and has an exit 3 
catch all code. The script should behave like any other Nagios plugin. 
It should run under any modern Linux distribution. It has been tested and known
to work under Debian based systems with Nagios 3.x

HISTORY
This plugin is based on check_temp which I wrote earlier this year. The code is
almost identical to it. Many thanks to Chad Columbus who sent me
bugfixes and corrections for check_temp. Without check_temp their would never
have been check_gputemp.
This plugin was submitted to Nagios Exchange in January 2012.

Version 1.3
Thanks to Ryan Loudfoot who added performance data to check_gputemp.
